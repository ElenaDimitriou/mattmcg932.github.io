I attended the CASTEP electron microscopy training workshop at the University of Oxford. I refreshed my knowledge on solid state physics and enjoyed being updated on current research. I met plenty of interesting people from different disciplines here too.

The [CASTEP workshop][castep-link] was aimed at researchers who wish to learn about density functional theory (DFT) methods and simulating crystalline interactions for solid state physics and chemistry. The 2018 workshop also included simulations supporting electron microscopy which was more relevant to me given my background in physics; I am interested in looking at ways of developing a reflectance technique which could be used in electron microscopy imaging. I found the workshop great to meet interesting people and useful to learn some new things about electron microscopy as well as refresh my knowledge on the area as a whole.

This summer I will attend the European Study Group with Industry (ESGI) 141 in at University College Dublin, Ireland. This workshop takes place on 25-29th of June.

Originating in Oxford in 1968, and since having been held several times a year across Europe, ESGI is a 7 day problem-solving workshop where academics work together with industrial partners to come up with solutions to specific problems which the industrial partner attendees would like to be addressed. 

Some of this year's [problems][ucd-problems] include Machine Learning for breeding genetics, Short term wind portfolio output forecasting, Liquid Wicking in Hierarchical Microstructures and Optimal Scheduling of Power Generation. 

More information on the Workshop at University College Dublin can be found [here][esgi-dublin].

I am looking forward to this ESGI workshop very much since it will be my first time attending.

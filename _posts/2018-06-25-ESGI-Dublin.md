This summer I attended the European Study Group with Industry (ESGI) 141 in at University College Dublin, Ireland. This workshop took place on 25-29th of June.

Originating in Oxford in 1968, and since having been held several times a year across Europe, ESGI is a 7 day problem-solving workshop where academics work together with industrial partners to come up with solutions to specific problems which the industrial partner attendees would like to be addressed. 

Some of this year's [problems][ucd-problems] included Machine Learning for breeding genetics, Short term wind portfolio output forecasting, Liquid Wicking in Hierarchical Microstructures and Optimal Scheduling of Power Generation. 
I worked on the Machine Learning problem with Prolego Scientific for breeding genetics problem where I learned about statistical methods applied to a biological data.
I thought this an incredibly innovative use for mathematical techniques I had not seen used in this context.


More information on the Workshop at University College Dublin can be found [here][esgi-dublin].

I thoroughly enjoyed this ESGI workshop, and would like to attend again given it was my first time attending.

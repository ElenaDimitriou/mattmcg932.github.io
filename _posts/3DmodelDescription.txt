RTI Coin 3D Model (preliminary)

Reflectance Transformation Imaging 3D Model (preliminary) of a coin on paper. There is a crease in the paper which has been represented accurately, however the edges of the coin are not well defined.

This model is somewhat crude since it was generated very quickly, but I hope to improve this process soon.
